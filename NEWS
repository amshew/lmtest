Changes in Version 0.9-15

  o new generic with flexible default method for lrtest(),
    implementing asymptotic likelihood ratio tests. This works
    if a logLik() method is provided and suitable methods for
    updating models and checking consistency.
    
  o simplified print output in coeftest()
  

Changes in Version 0.9-14

  o now a default method for waldtest() is provided (replacing the
    lm method). It works for "lm", "glm" and "survreg" objects.    
    Furtheremore, it is object-oriented and generally works if the
    following methods are available: terms(), formula(), coef() (which
    needs to be named, matching the names in terms() and vcov()),
    vcov() (which can alternatively be user-supplied), df.residual(),
    residuals() and update() (unless only fitted objects are supplied).
    
  o the default coeftest() was enhanced, works now out of the box for
    "mle" objects, a "survreg" method is added (needed because coef()
    and vcov() do not necessarily match for "survreg" objects).
    
  o the vcov argument was changed (almost) everywhere to vcov. to 
    avoid name clashes with the vcov() function.
