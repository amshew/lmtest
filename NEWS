Changes in Version 0.9-19

  o fixed error in Mandible data. Mandible[158,2] was 34 but
    should really be 37 (see Table 1 in Royston & Altman 1994).
    Spotted by Christian Ritz.


Changes in Version 0.9-19

  o changed the default behaviour of waldtest.default():
    Chisq test (instead of F test) is now used by default
    which is more sensible for most models (with linear
    models as a notable exception).

  o added waldtest.lm() method that switches the default
    test back to F test (instead of Chisq test).


Changes in Version 0.9-18

  o forgot to export print() method for "coeftest" objects


Changes in Version 0.9-17

  o added NAMESPACE

  o improved dependency declaration in DESCRIPTION


Changes in Version 0.9-16

  o updated all .rda data sets to RDX2

  o enhanced sanity checking in dwtest()


Changes in Version 0.9-15

  o new generic with flexible default method for lrtest(),
    implementing asymptotic likelihood ratio tests. This works
    if a logLik() method is provided and suitable methods for
    updating models and checking consistency.
    
  o simplified print output in coeftest()
  

Changes in Version 0.9-14

  o now a default method for waldtest() is provided (replacing the
    lm method). It works for "lm", "glm" and "survreg" objects.    
    Furtheremore, it is object-oriented and generally works if the
    following methods are available: terms(), formula(), coef() (which
    needs to be named, matching the names in terms() and vcov()),
    vcov() (which can alternatively be user-supplied), df.residual(),
    residuals() and update() (unless only fitted objects are supplied).
    
  o the default coeftest() was enhanced, works now out of the box for
    "mle" objects, a "survreg" method is added (needed because coef()
    and vcov() do not necessarily match for "survreg" objects).
    
  o the vcov argument was changed (almost) everywhere to vcov. to 
    avoid name clashes with the vcov() function.
