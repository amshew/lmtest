`lmtest' is an R package of tests on the standard assumptions of linear
models by Achim Zeileis and Torsten Hothorn.
An earlier version was written by Torsten Hothorn and Frederik von Ameln.

It implements a wide variety of tests typically encountered in econometric
analysis. This collection of tests is complemented by the tests available
in the packages `car' and `strucchange'.

The work on the package was inspired by the book "The Linear Regression Model
Under Test" by Kraemer and Sonnberger (1986). We tried to reproduce the
examples given in the book, but that was not always possible or differes more
or less seriously. However, many results can be (almost) reproduced, see the
examples for the data sets for details.
